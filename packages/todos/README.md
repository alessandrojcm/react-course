# TODOS project

This project just pulls data from the JSON placeholder API.
It allows the user to select posts or todos from the api and then
it renders it to the screen. The project's purpose is to showcase hooks.

Differences from Stephen's code:
* It uses `semantic-ui-css` package.
* It has css styling via Semantic UI.
